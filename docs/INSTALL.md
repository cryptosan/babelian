At Linux/Mac OS X, the Python is installed by default.  
so you don't need to install `Python` in another way.  
Let's install `Babelian`.

## Check Python
In terminal, type `python -V`.  
then you can see your python version.

## Install by pip
pip is a manager program of Python that can control some modules easily.  

#### 1. Check pip
In terminal, type `pip -V`.  
```shell
$ pip 6.1.1 from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip-6.1.1-py2.7.egg (python 2.7)
```
If you can see above, then your Computer has `pip`.  
The message means that i already have `pip`, and the version is `6.1.1` and Python is `2.7`.
