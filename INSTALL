# Install Guide
In Linux/Mac OS X, Python is already installed.  
so you don't need to install `Python` in another way.  
Let's install `Babelian`.  

**Make sure before type install command!**

## Check Python
In terminal(as Console), type `python -V`.  
then you can see your python version.

If you can't see any Python version.  
Go to `Google`, search `install python`.

## Install by pip
`pip` is a manager program of Python that can control some modules easily.  

#### 1. Check pip
In terminal, type `pip -V`.  
```shell
$ pip 6.1.1 from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip-6.1.1-py2.7.egg (python 2.7)
```
If you can see above, then your Computer has `pip`.  
The message means that i already have `pip`, and the version is `6.1.1` and Python is `2.7`.  
So go to [Install babelian](#3-install-babelian).
